        <h2>Third War - Lancastrian War</h2>

            <p>
                Up until about 1428, England were dominate during this stage of the war occupying all of northern France while retaining their land in the south from before the war from the French. After the Siege of Orleans, talked about later, the French are able to slowly regain all of the English occupied land through successful battles and seiges. After the Treaty of Picquigny the only territory that England still controled on the European mainland was Calais, which they retained until the mid sixteenth century.

            <dt><strong>Battle of Agincout - 1415</strong></dt>
            <dd>Near Calais, Henry V, the king of England at the time, invaded Normandy with a large army comprised of knights and archers. Not long after the invasion, Henry's army was overcome by casualties and dysentery, and the French army marching to attack. Henry decided to arrange his men so that their flanks were protected by the orchards of two nearby villages, while putting his troops in blocks with archers nearby. When the French attacked, they used the same strategy as they did at Poiters in 1356, and were massacered as they were in 1356.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Siege of Orleans - 1428-1429</strong></dt>
            <dd>Along the middle of the Loire River, the Siege of Orleans is considered to be the turning point of the war, because if the English had successfully sieged the town it would have meant that they had complete control of all French lands north of the Loire River. However, history being as it is, a young French girl named Joan of Arc rallied the French cause by lifting the siege. Joan was able to do this by attacking the English besiegers in tandom with the Orlean garrison, routing the English. Joan's victory was not that long lasting as she was captured by Burgundains, allied to England at this point, and given to the English as a prisoner in 1431. She would later die, labeled as a witch by the English, by being burnt at the stake.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Battle of Castillon - 1453</strong></dt>
            <dd>Near Bordeaux, the Battle of Castillon was the last battle fought during the Lancastrian War, and the Hundred Years War alltogether. Trying to retain some of Englands land in southern France, Henry VI sends an army to stop the French siege of Castillon. However the English are thoroughly defeated, and routed from France until the end of the war.</dd>
