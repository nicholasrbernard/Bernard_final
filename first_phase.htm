        <h2>First War - Edwardian Era War</h2>

            <p>
                The Edwardian Era War began in 1337 with desicive blows made be the English early on in the war at the Battles of Sluys and Cercy. However, during this phase of the war was when the Black Plauge was spreading throughout Europe, where the war basically stopped for about six years. During that time England rought lost one third of its population while France lost roughly one fourth of its. However, after those six years England reinstated the war by raiding towns in southern France, and, incidently, dealt one of the final blows to France at the Battle of Poiters. The war ends in a thorough English victory at the Treaty of Bretigny where England gained complete control over the Duchy of Guyenne and control over Calais, while giving up the claim to the French throne.

            <dt><strong>Battle of Sluys - 1340</strong></dt>
            <dd>This was the first major battle, and a naval battle, in the war and was a decisive victory for the English because it secured the English Channel allowing for reinforcements to cross the channel easily.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Battle of Cercy - 1346</strong></dt>
            <dd>As one of the key land battles early in the war both sides needed a victory to advance their position in the war. That victory went to the English who were easily outnumbered by the French, but were able to use new tactics and weapons, like the Welsh longbow and pikes developed in Switzerland, to deliver a crushing blow to the French army, both in manpower and pride.</dd>
            <dt><strong>Battle of Poiters - 1356</strong></dt>
            <dd>The Battle of Poiters can be considered one of the final blows in he Edwardian Era War, because the French repeated their tactic at Cercy and were slaughtered like they were at Cercy. Although the French almost won the battle, but the general of the English army, heir to the throne of England and also know as the Black Prince, was able to launch a counter attack which was what decimated the French army.</dd>
