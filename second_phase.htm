        <h2>Second War - Caroline War</h2>

            <p>
                The Caroline War began in 1369 and was in Frances favor for almost the entire war. There isn't much to say about this war other than France slowly gained control over its lost holdings in the previous war. The result of the was that France regained all of its lost territory from the previous war plus a large portion of English held land between Bordeaux and Bayonne.

            <dt>Battle of La Rochelle - 1372</dt>
            <dd>This battle was key to the current war for France, because it was after this battle that they had control of the English Channel. Controling the English Channel in French eyes meant that it would be almost impossible for the English to reinforce their armies on the mainland. Also this allowed the French to raid the English coast for the first time since the beginning of the Hundred Years War.</dd>
