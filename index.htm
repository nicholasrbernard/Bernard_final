        <p>
            The Hundred Years War can be considered one of the most noteable wars in history. These series of wars consists of three wars primarily between France and England with other major European powers also joining in on the wars. These conflicts can be considered one of the bloodier timeperiods of the world, due to the massive amount of lives lost for the time period.
