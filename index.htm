        <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>
                The Hundred Years War can be considered one of the most noteable wars in history. These series of wars consists of three wars primarily between France and England while other major European powers also joining in on the wars. These conflicts can be considered one of the bloodier timeperiods of the world, due to the massive amount of lives lost for the time period.

        <h3>Prelude to the Wars</h3>

            <p>
                With the last French king of the Capetian dynasty dying without a male heir in 1328, England, with Edward III as the ruler, sought to claim the French throne because Edward was the nearest male relative. However, since Edward was the son of the former kings daughter, The Parlement of Paris ruled that claims to the throne could not be passed down through women. Thus, the crown of France was passed to the first cousin of the former king, Philip VI. There were two other reasons that the first war kicked off. One was the fact that Philip wanted to claim the status of liege lord over Edward due to England owning lands in Gascony, southwestern France, but as Edward was also a king, so he believed that he should not accept another king as his superior. The other reason the war kicked off was Philip interfering in Flanders by putting down some revolts which slowed wool trade, profitable for the English and Flemish, cutting into the economy of England.

        <h3>First War</h3>

            <p>
                The first war is nicknamed the <a href = "first_phase.htm">Edwardian Era War</a> which began in 1337 and lasted until 1360. Some of the noteable battles during this war were the battles of Sluys, Crecy, and Poiters. This war ultimately ended in the victory for the English with the Treaty of Bretigny.
            </p>

        <h3>Second War</h3>

            <p>
                The second war is named the <a href = "second_phase.htm">Caroline War</a> beginning in 1369 while lasting until 1389 and an extention on the peace treaty was signed in 1396 which cause there to be a 28 year lull between wars. During this war there weren't as many major battles, but one to note is the battle of La Rochelle. This war ended with victory for the French with the Treaty of Bruges.
            </p>

        <h3>Third War</h3>

            <p>
                The third war is named the <a href = "third_phase.htm">Lancastrian War</a> lasting from 1415 until 1453, although England and France remained formally at war until 1475. Noteable battles during the third war are the Battle of Agincourt, the Siege of Orleans, and the Battle of Castillon. This war won the Hundred Years War for France at the Treaty of Picquigny.

        <h3>Aftermath</h3>

            <p>
                Even thought the Hundred Years War came to an end, the repurcussions were devastating. During the war there was constant looting of the countryside, death in the hundred of thousands, and lots of political turmoil. An example would be the ravaging of countrysides even after the war from <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_company" title = "free companies">free companies</a> due to not being paid for their services in the war. Another example would be England ending up in the War of the Roses, which was a political struggle between two families of nobles in England vying for the throne. Also, the new kind of warfare and tactics used during the Hundred Years War put Europe of the course for fighting at greater distances.
