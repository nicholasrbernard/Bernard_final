        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            The Hundred Years War can be considered one of the most noteable wars in history. These series of wars consists of three wars primarily between France and England while other major European powers also joining in on the wars. These conflicts can be considered one of the bloodier timeperiods of the world, due to the massive amount of lives lost for the time period.

        <h3>Prelude to the Wars</h3>

        <p>
            With the last French king of the Capetian dynasty dieing without a male heir in 1328, England, with Edward III as the ruler, sought to claim the French throne because Edward was the nearest male relative. However, since Edward was the son of the former kings daughter, The Parlement of Paris ruled that claims to the throne could not be passed down through women. Thus, the crown of France was passed to the first cousin of the former king, Philip VI. There were two other reasons that the first war kicked off. One was the fact that Philip wanted to claim the status of liege lord over Edward due to England owning lands in Gascony, southwestern France, but as Edward was also a king, so he believed that he should not accept another king as his superior. The other reason the war kicked off was Philip interfering in Flanders by putting down some revolts which slowed wool trade, profitable for the English and Flemish, cutting into the economy of England.
